# Features

âœ” **Stable Diffusion Model** â€“ Generates high-quality, realistic images from text prompts.

âœ” **ComfyUI Integration** â€“ Allows a node-based, drag-and-drop workflow for easy modifications.

âœ” **Customizable Parameters** â€“ Users can adjust sampling steps, resolution, and styles for better image quality.

âœ” **Efficient Image Refinement** â€“ Supports iterative enhancements and fine-tuning before finalizing.

âœ” **Optimized for Different Hardware**â€“ Compatible with both CPU and GPU-based processing.

# Usage

1. Launch ComfyUI and load the Stable Diffusion model.
2. Enter a textual prompt describing the image concept (available in prompts.md.
3. Modify parameters such as resolution, sampling steps, and style for better results.
4. Use ComfyUIâ€™s interactive workflow to tweak and refine outputs.
5. Generate and save the final image for further use.
